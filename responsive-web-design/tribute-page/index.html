              <p>AC/DC, Australian heavy metal band whose theatrical, high-energy shows placed them among the most
                popular stadium performers of the 1980s. The principal members were Angus Young(b. March 31, 1955,
                Glasgow, Scotland),Malcolm Young(b. January 6, 1953, Glasgow—d. November 18, 2017, Sydney, Australia),
                Bon Scott (original name Ronald Belford Scott;b. July 9, 1946, Kirriemuir, Angus, Scotland—d. February
                21, 1980, London, England), Brian Johnson(b. October 5, 1947, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear,
                England), Phil Rudd (original name Phillip Rudzevecuis;b. May 19, 1954, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia),
                and Cliff Williams(b. December 14, 1949, Romford, Essex, England).</p>

            <li>
              <p>The Young brothers formed AC/DC in Sydney, Australia, in 1973 with Angus (famous for his schoolboy
                short-trousers outfit) on lead guitar and Malcolm on rhythm guitar. The rest of the band’s lineup
                changed when the Youngs moved to Melbourne, and AC/DC’s blues-based records and live appearances made
                them favourites in Australia by the mid-1970s. The band relocated to London in 1976 and found success in
                Britain with Let There Be Rock (1977). After solidifying their lineup (with Scott as vocalist, Rudd on
                drums, Williams on bass, and the Youngs), the band recorded Highway to Hell (1979), which brought them
                international fame. AC/DC’s rise was hampered by Scott’s alcohol-related death in February 1980, but
                replacement Johnson’s falsetto fit in well with the group’s tight, clean metal punch and their raucous
                bad-boy image. The band’s next album, Back in Black (1980), sold more than 10 million copies in the
                United States alone, and For Those About to Rock (1981) was also a million-seller. The early to
                mid-1980s was the band’s peak period as a live group; a number of personnel changes occurred after that
                time.</p>

            <li>
              <p>By the 1990s AC/DC found itself comfortably ensconced among the elder statesmen of heavy metal. The
                Razor’s Edge (1990) featured the hit singles “Thunderstruck” and “Moneytalks,” the latter of which
                reached number 23 on the Billboard chart, making it the group’s sole Top 40 single. The band settled
                into a pattern of roughly two studio releases per decade, following The Razor’s Edge with Ballbreaker
                (1995), produced by Rick Rubin, and Stiff Upper Lip (2000), an album that attempted to capture the
                stadium-filling sound of the Back in Black era. After more than 30 years of producing some of the
                roughest and loudest head-banging anthems in heavy metal history, AC/DC scored its first Billboard
                number one album with Black Ice (2008). The band reached another milestone in 2010 when it collected its
                first Grammy Award (in the category of best hard rock performance) for the single “War Machine.”</p>
